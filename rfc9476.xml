      used in non-DNS contexts. It also provides advice and guidance to

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Many Internet protocols need to name entities. Names that look like
      DNS names (a series of labels separated with dots) have become common,
      even in systems that are not part of the global DNS administered by
      IANA. This document reserves the top-level label "alt" (short for
      "alternative") as a special-use domain name <xref target="RFC6761"
      format="default"/>. This top-level label can be used as the final
      (rightmost) label to signify that the name is not rooted in the global
      DNS and that it should not be resolved using the DNS protocol.</t>
      <t>As detailed in <xref target="iana-6761" format="default"/>, IANA has
      added the .alt name to the "Special-Use Domain Name" registry. IANA
      sets aside names in that registry, as described in <eref
      target="https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved" brackets="angle"/>.</t>

<!-- [rfced] Regarding Section 1:
a) Would you like to switch these two paragraphs so that the
explanation of the usage of ".alt" instead of "alt" comes before the
IANA request?
b) Would you like to use the phrase 'the top-level label "alt"'
to match how it appears in the first paragraph of Section 1?

Original:
   In Section 3.1, the IANA is requested to add the .alt name to the
   "Special-Use Domain Name" registry.  IANA sets aside names in that
   registry, as described in https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved.

   Throughout the rest of this document, the top-level "alt" label is
   shown as ".alt" to match the common presentation form of DNS names.

      <t>Throughout the rest of this document, the top-level "alt" label is
      shown as ".alt" to match the common presentation form of DNS names.</t>
      <t>The techniques in this document are primarily intended to address
      some of the issues discussed in <xref target="RFC8244"
      format="default"/>, which contains additional background on the issues
      with special-use domain names.</t>
      <t>In this document, ".alt" was chosen for the special-use domain name
      instead of something like "alt.arpa" so that systems that use the name
      do not have to worry that a parent of their name would be resolved if
      the name leaked to the Internet. Historically, some systems that want to
      use non-DNS names wanted the entire name to be not in the DNS, and
      reserving ".alt" fulfills that use case.</t>

      <name>The alt Namespace</name>
      <t>This document reserves the .alt label
      for use as an unmanaged pseudo-TLD
      namespace. The .alt label can be used in any domain name as a pseudo-TLD
      to signify that this is an alternative (non-DNS) namespace and should
      not be looked up in a DNS context.</t>
      <t>This document uses ".alt" for the pseudo-TLD in the presentation
      format for the DNS, corresponding to a 0x03616c7400 suffix in DNS wire format.
      The on-the-wire formats for non-DNS protocols might be
      different.</t>
      <t>Because names beneath .alt are in an alternative namespace, they have no
      significance in the regular DNS context. DNS stub and recursive resolvers
      do not need to look them up in the DNS context.</t>
      <t>DNS resolvers that serve the DNS protocol and non-DNS protocols at the
      same time might consider .alt like a DNS entry in the
      "Transport-Independent Locally-Served DNS Zone Registry" that is part of
      IANA's "Locally-Served DNS Zones" registry, except that .alt is always
      used to denote names that are to be resolved by non-DNS protocols. Note
      that this document does not request adding .alt to these registries
      because .alt, by this specification, is not a DNS name.</t>
      <t>Note that using .alt as a pseudo-TLD does not mandate how the non-DNS
      protocol will handle the name. To maximize compatibility with existing
      applications, it is suggested, but not required, that non-DNS protocols
      using names that end in .alt follow DNS name syntax. If the non-DNS
      protocol has a wire format like the DNS wire format, it might append the
      null label at the end of the name, but it also might not. This document
      does not make any suggestion for how non-DNS protocols deal with the wire
      format of their names.</t>
      <t>Groups wishing to create new alternative namespaces may create their
      alternative namespace under a label that names their namespace under the
      .alt pseudo-TLD. This document defines neither a registry nor a governance
      model for the .alt namespace, as it is not managed by the IETF or IANA.
      There is no guarantee of unambiguous mappings from names to name
      resolution mechanisms. Mitigation or resolution of collisions that occur
      under .alt are outside the scope of this document and outside the IETF's remit.
      Users are advised to consider the associated risks when using names under .alt.</t>
      <t>Regardless of the expectations above, names in the .alt pseudo-TLD will leak
      outside the context in which they are valid. Decades of experience show that
      such names will appear at recursive resolvers and will thus also appear at the
      root servers for the global DNS.</t>
      <t>Sending traffic to the root servers that is known to always elicit an
      NXDOMAIN response, such as queries for names ending in .alt, wastes
      resources on both the resolver and the root server.
      Caching resolvers performing aggressive use of DNSSEC-validated caches
      (described in <xref target="RFC8198" format="default"/>) may mitigate this by
      synthesizing negative answers from cached NSEC records for names under
      .alt. Similarly, caching resolvers using QNAME
      minimization (described in <xref target="RFC9156" format="default"/>)
      will cause less of this traffic to the root servers because the negative
      responses will cover all names under .alt.</t>
      <t>Currently deployed projects and protocols that are using pseudo-TLDs
      are recommended to move under the .alt pseudo-TLD, but this is not a requirement.
      Rather, the .alt pseudo-TLD is being reserved so that current and future
      projects of a similar nature have a designated place to create
      alternative resolution namespaces that will not conflict with the
      regular DNS context.</t>

        relevant or well suited.</t>
      <ol type="1" spacing="normal">
        <li>Users might or might not recognize that names in the .alt
        pseudo-TLD as special.</li>
        <li>Application software that uses alternative namespaces in the .alt
        pseudo-TLD are expected to have their own processing rules for their
        own names, probably in specialized resolver APIs, libraries, and/or
        application software.  Application software that is not specifically
        designed to use names in the .alt pseudo-TLD are not expected to make
        their software recognize these names as special.</li>
        <li>Developers of name resolution APIs and libraries that are
        specifically designed to implement resolution of an alternative name
        resolution system are expected to recognize names in the .alt
        pseudo-TLD as special and thus perform resolution of those names. The
        exact mechanism used by the name resolution APIs and libraries will
        obviously depend on the particular alternative resolution
        system. Regular DNS resolution APIs and libraries are not expected to
        recognize or treat names in the .alt pseudo-TLD differently.</li>

        <li>DNS server operators will treat names in the .alt pseudo-TLD as
        they would names in any other TLD not in the global DNS. DNS server
        operators may be aware that queries for names ending in .alt are not
        DNS names and that queries for those names were leaked into the DNS
        context. This information can be useful for support or debugging
        purposes.</li>
        <li>It is not possible for DNS registries/registrars to register DNS
        names in the .alt pseudo-TLD as the .alt will not exist in the global

      <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
      <t>This document reserves .alt to be used to indicate that a name is not
      a DNS name. Unfortunately, these queries will undoubtedly leak into the
      global DNS. This is a general problem with alternative namespaces and not
      confined to names ending in .alt.</t>
      <t>For example, a value such as "example.alt" could easily cause a
      privacy issue for any names in that namespace that are leaked to the
      Internet.  
<!--[rfced] Does "the value" refer to the "name", or is it separate?
Also, should the meaning of "(re-)identification" be written out
with "and" or "or"?

Original:
   In addition, if a name ending in .alt is sufficiently
   unique, long-lasting, and frequently leaks into the global DNS, then
   regardless of how the value is constructed, that value can act
   similar to a web cookie with all the associated downsides of
   (re-)identification.

Perhaps (if "the value" is the name mentioned at the start):

      <t>Because names in the .alt pseudo-TLD are explicitly outside of the
